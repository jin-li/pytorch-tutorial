# PyTorch MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition (1)

This folder contains the code used in the article [Learn PyTorch with Examplesï¼ˆ1ï¼‰ï¼šPyTorch Basics and MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition (I)](https://jinli.io/en/p/learn-pytorch-with-examples1pytorch-basics-and-mnist-handwritten-digit-recognition-i/).

## Quick Start

First, you need to create a Python virtual environment to run this project. You can use `virtualenv` or `conda` and other tools to create a virtual environment. You can refer to my article [Python Environment Management with venv/conda/mamba](https://jinli.io/en/p/python-environment-management-with-venv/conda/mamba/).

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the code:

```bash
python mnist_nn.py
```
