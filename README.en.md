# Learn PyTorch with Examples

## Introduction

This project contains the code used in the "Learn PyTorch with Examples" series of articles, including all the code examples in the articles.

Based on the official PyTorch examples, the code examples have been appropriately modified and explained in detail, with necessary comments added, and many utility codes have been added to help analyze and compare.

In the process of self-learning PyTorch, the author found that the official PyTorch example code is very good, but it may not be easy for beginners to get started. Therefore, based on his own learning experience, the author has appropriately modified and explained the official example code to help beginners better understand the basic knowledge of machine learning and deep learning, and how this knowledge is applied to actual code through PyTorch.

## Article List

The "Learn PyTorch with Examples" series of articles are published on the author's personal blog, with both Chinese and English versions. The list of articles is as follows:

- [Learn PyTorch by Examples (1): MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition (I) -- PyTorch Basics and Neural Network Basics](https://jinli.io/en/p/learn-pytorch-by-examples-1-mnist-handwritten-digit-recognition-i--pytorch-basics-and-neural-network-basics/)
- [Learn PyTorch by Examples (2): MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition (II) -- Parameter Selection in Neural Network](https://jinli.io/en/p/learn-pytorch-by-examples-2-mnist-handwritten-digit-recognition-ii--parameter-selection-in-neural-network/)
- [Learn PyTorch by Examples (3): MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition (III) -- Convolutional Neural Networks](https://jinli.io/en/p/learn-pytorch-by-examples-3-mnist-handwritten-digit-recognition-iii--convolutional-neural-networks/)
- [Learn PyTorch by Examples (4): Sequence Prediction (I) -- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)](https://jinli.io/en/p/learn-pytorch-by-examples-4-sequence-prediction-i--recurrent-neural-networks-rnn/)
- [Learn PyTorch by Examples (5): Sequence Prediction (II) -- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)](https://jinli.io/en/p/learn-pytorch-by-examples-5-sequence-prediction-ii--gated-recurrent-unit-gru-and-long-short-term-memory-lstm/)
- [Learn PyTorch by Examples (6): Language Model (I) -- Implementing a Word-Level Language Model with LSTM](https://jinli.io/en/p/learn-pytorch-by-examples-6-language-model-i--implementing-a-word-level-language-model-with-lstm/)


## Quick Start

The code for each project is placed in a separate folder, with the folder number corresponding to the article number. Each folder contains a `README.md` file with the steps to run the code.

- If you only want to run a specific project, you can read the `README.md` file of that project and follow the steps.
- If you want to learn more about a specific project, you can read the article corresponding to that project.

The Python environment required for each project is separate, and the dependencies required for each project are listed in the `requirements.txt` file in the folder. Readers can create a virtual environment as needed and then install the dependencies. For information on creating and managing Python virtual environments, please refer to the author's article [Python Environment Management with venv/conda/mamba](https://jinli.io/en/p/python-environment-management-with-venv/conda/mamba/).
